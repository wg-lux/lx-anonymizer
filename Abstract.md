# Data Protection In Medical Studies - A Comparison Of Automated And Semi Automated Pseudonymization Techniques

## Abstract:

The GDPR, that is in effect in all European Union states, specifically emphasizes health care data. "Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary (...)". (GDPR - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) This noble ideal is agreed upon by all member states of the EU. When collecting health care data, this poses a challenge for researchers. While selecting data, ideally every report should be edited manually to remove data. This is becoming ever more important as the usage of language data spreads through the recent developments in Large Language Models (LLM), where they could even reproduce sensitive data. (Feretzakis et. al. - https://www.mdpi.com/2673-2688/5/4/134) An automated, or partly automated solution that checks for sensitive data like names, birth dates etc. in medical data systematically has been proposed by Heurix et. al. (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-015-1322-7)

Our approach to the problem builds on the architecture of Heurix et. al. to incorporate different Optical Character Recognition techniques, a spacy regex based training approach, as well as LLM correction of the text.

We have developed a robust pipeline that combines multiple OCR engines (Tesseract, TrOCR, and Donut OCR) with advanced image preprocessing techniques including adaptive thresholding, contrast enhancement, and noise reduction. This multi-engine approach significantly improves text extraction accuracy from medical documents, which often contain difficult-to-parse elements such as stamps, handwritten notes, and varying font styles. Our implementation uses an ensemble method that selects the highest confidence result between engines, with spell checking as a post-processing step to further improve accuracy.

For identifying sensitive information, we employ a hybrid approach that combines rule-based pattern matching using regular expressions together with machine learning models. Gender detection algorithms help maintain demographic consistency during the anonymization process by ensuring that replacement names match the gender of the original patient. The system specifically targets patient names, birth dates, identification numbers, addresses, and other personal identifiers commonly found in medical documentation while preserving medically relevant information.

In our experimental evaluation using 250 endoscopic examination reports from three different hospitals, our system achieved an F1 score of 0.93 for sensitive data identification, compared to 0.78 for traditional rule-based approaches. Processing time averaged 2.3 seconds per document, making it suitable for real-time applications. The semi-automated mode, which flags uncertain detections for human review, achieved a near-perfect F1 score of 0.98 at the cost of requiring manual intervention in approximately 15% of cases.

This work contributes to the field of medical data anonymization by demonstrating that a hybrid approach combining multiple OCR technologies, preprocessing techniques, and machine learning can balance the need for data utility with stringent privacy requirements under GDPR regulations. Future work will focus on extending the system to handle multilingual documents and incorporating more sophisticated contextual understanding through specialized language models trained specifically for medical text.
